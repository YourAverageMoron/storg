# Content-addressible storage in GO :)

## What I've learnt
- Working more with golang and concurrency in go
    - First bug project in go
- Better understanding of working with tcp
- Better understanding of distributed systems


Next steps after this - https://fly.io/dist-sys/ - This looks like it could build on some of the stuff in this prject might be good to look into
